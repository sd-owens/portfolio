        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="text-left"> 
        I am a software engineer studying Computer Science at Oregon State University. I hold a previous bachelor’s degree in business and over 10 years of progressive experience as a program manager in one of the most technically demanding fields in the U.S. Armed Forces, the Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion program.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="text-left">
        Throughout my military service, I have been a part of a program with a culture of continuous learning, exacting standards, and innovative solutions to highly technical problems.  I have led numerous highly-effective, cross-functional teams of subject matter experts to collaborate and achieve organizational goals and objectives.
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="text-left">
        This culture of team collaboration and continuous learning is what drives my desire to pursue a career in technology after the Navy.  Software development is a constantly evolving field that requires the same principles of constant learning, devotion and the cultural mindset that I have lived throughout my military service. I have an active SECRET clearance and I am available for employment in September 2020.
        </p>

        <h4>Military Service</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="text-left">
            I joined the Navy in 1998 immediately after high school to earn money for an education and make a better life for myself.  I chose the Navy for it's nuclear propulsion program; it was the most challenging and interesting program that I could find that matched my passion for math and science, because unfortunately information technology was not yet a career option in the Navy at that time.  I excelled in the military, quickly rising to the rank of Chief Petty Offier after only 7 years  and advancing to Master Chief Petty Officer after only 16 years of service. 
        </p>
            
        <h4>Hobbies</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="text-left">
            I enjoy hiking, running, and all things technology.  When I am not at work I find myself learning about or tinkering with the lastest smart home technology devices or working on my personal side project to build and program my own semi-autonomous quadcopter drone.  Why buy it when you can build and program it yourself?
